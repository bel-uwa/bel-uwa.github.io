The behavioural economics laboratory was established to puruse research in three main areas: (a) the economics of climate change adaptation, (b) connections between climate change policy and adaptation behaviours, and (c) behavioural economic analyses of other ecosystem issues.

## Current Projects
Some current and future research themes being pursued within the lab include:

* *Individual and collective behaviours with respect to the natural environment*
* *Contributions to public goods and free riding behaviour, particularly in the context of biosecurity, climate change, and vaccination*
* *Distributional (fairness) preferences, self-serving bias, and equity-efficiency trade-offs*
* *Competitive tenders for non-priced goods*
* *Risk taking, risk sharing, incentives, and institutional context*
* *Natural resource management as a function of social interactions* 
* *Understanding and enhancing people's mental models of climate change*
* *Exploring the psychological and social factors that predict engagement with climate change and pro-environmental behaviours*
* *Using insights from behavioural economics to improve the communiction of climate science*
* *Integrating models of memory with theories of decision making*
