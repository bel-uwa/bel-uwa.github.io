  <h2>Participants</h2>

<p>Would you like to help us out by taking part in one of our research studies? Our lab conducts a number of experiments throughout the year for which we require a steady supply of participants. These experiments are incentivized, meaning that you will be paid for your participation. Typically participants will receive two payments: one is a &quot;show-up&quot; fee of $10 for attending the experiment, whilst the second is a &quot;performance fee&quot;, which is contingent upon the decisions each participant makes throughout the course of the experiment, and the decisions of other participants. The performance fee typically varies between $10 and $50 per experiment.</p>

<!-- <p> As well as earning money, the experiments are fun, provide a valuable learning experience, and offer you the chance to contribute to a novel piece of experimental research. </p> -->

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Anyone who is over 18 years of age is eligible to take part in experiments conducted in the lab. Most of our participants are University students attending UWA or other Perth based Universities but we warmly welcome individuals from outside the University communities. </p>

<!-- We greatly appreciate the contribution of participants to our research. -->

<h2>Ethics</h2>

<p>All experiments conducted in the laboratory undergo rigerous assessment by the Human Research Ethics Office of the University of Western Australia. There are no risks associated with taking part in experiments and you will not be subjected to harm. No experiments performed in the lab involve deception.</p>

<h2>How do I take part?</h2>

<p>All experiments performed in the lab are administered by the <a href="http://orsee.are.uwa.edu.au/public/">Online Recruitment System for Economic Experiments (ORSEE)</a>. You will first need to register for an account with ORSEE, after which you will be able to view and sign up for experiments by logging into the system. You will also be added to a mailing list of people who will receive invitations to take part in specific experiments. Participation in these experiments is entirely voluntary and you can always choose to decline the invitation to participate.</p>

<!-- There are broadly two types of experiments conducted in the lab:

* **Group interaction experiments** examine the decision making skills of a group (or multiple groups) of interacting individuals. Participants in these experiments receive two payments: one is a "show-up" fee of $10 for attending the experiment; the second is a "performance fee", which is contingent upon the decisions participants make, both individually and collectively, during the course of the experiment. The performance fee typically varies between $10 and $50 per experiment.

* **Individual decision making experiments** examine the decision making skills of individual participants. Although multiple participants may be tested in the same session, they make decisions independently without interacting with one another. Participants in these experiments are paid an hourly rate of between $10 and $15. -->
