<p>Welcome to the new website for the Behavioural Economics Laboratory (BEL) @ UWA! The site is powered by the the static site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, an open source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites, and the Jekyll butler <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Poole</a>, which provides a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install. The site is hosted freely on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.   </p>

<p>On this site you can learn more about the lab, the people that use it, and current as well as future research projects. Just use the navigation bar at the top and bottom of the page to learn more.</p>

<p>Be sure to visit us regularly to find out what new things are happening in the lab. </p>
