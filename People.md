**Research interests**
<p> I am an environmental and resource economist. I have experience in using many tools such as laboratory and field experiments, agent based modelling, bio-economic modelling and community surveys. I have research interests on many aspects of natural resource and environmental management, such as, agri-environmental service payment, inter-generational equity, role of social networks, endogenous network formation, coordination games,  preferences of equity norms, equity-efficiency trade-offs, risk aversion in public decision making, mechanism design and non-market valuation of water resources. </p>

**Research interests**
<p> Steven Schilizzi’s current research interests focus around two main problems: first, to understand what factors explain bidding behaviour and bidder participation in competitive tenders used for environmental conservation, and their resulting economic performance; and second, to understand what factors explain people’s views of “what’s fair” (or equitable) in connection with resource allocation or distribution of burdens, and how that interacts with resource use efficiency. Both research programs rely heavily on experimental research, in the lab but also in the field.
Steven will be supervising a PhD student who will be using experiments to study whether competitive tenders can enhance the willingness of participants to collaborate in situations of joint-benefit co-production, while another (using e.g. insights from cooperative game theory)  will study which design and operational factors contribute best to the success of agricultural cooperatives. </p>
