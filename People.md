<p> I am an environmental and resource economist. I have experience in using many tools such as laboratory and field experiments, agent based modelling, bio-economic modelling and community surveys. I have research interests on many aspects of natural resource and environmental management, such as, agri-environmental service payment, inter-generational equity, role of social networks, endogenous network formation, coordination games,  preferences of equity norms, equity-efficiency trade-offs, risk aversion in public decision making, mechanism design and non-market valuation of water resources. </p>
