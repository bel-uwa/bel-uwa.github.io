**Research interests**
<p> My research has primarily been in the area of individual behaviour and choice, with an emphasis on consumer demand, farmer behaviour and non-market valuation techniques. Much of that research has been based on stated preference surveys, with an interest in extending our understanding of what underlies heterogeneity in peoples responses. I have 77 publications in refereed journals, and an H-index of 18 on both ISI and Scopus data bases. In recent years I have been responsible for winning grants involving CSIRO Flagship programs, a CSIRO Cluster, and a CERF Research Hub. I have supervised 16 PhD students to completion. </p>

**Research interests**
<p> Dr Zoe Leviston is a social psychologist with the CSIRO's Land & Water Flagship. Her research investigates how individuals, groups, and culture shape people's responses to natural resource challenges, including water security, agricultural management, and resource consumption. Dr Leviston applies social science to a broad range of natural resource domains, however, her key research foci are in climate change mitigation and adaptation, agricultural land management practice, and public acceptance of water supply schemes. Her particular research interests concern how elements such as social identity, personality traits, and beliefs about others' social behaviour influence how we process information about environmental threats such as climate change and fossil fuel-based energy production. Dr Leviston's current research investigates the Australian public's response to climate change, including adaptation literacy, pro-environmental behaviour, and coping. </p>

<img class="right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}images/steve.jpg"alt="" title="Steven Schilizzi">

**Research interests**
<p> Steven Schilizzi’s current research interests focus around two main problems: first, to understand what factors explain bidding behaviour and bidder participation in competitive tenders used for environmental conservation, and their resulting economic performance; and second, to understand what factors explain people’s views of “what’s fair” (or equitable) in connection with resource allocation or distribution of burdens, and how that interacts with resource use efficiency. Both research programs rely heavily on experimental research, in the lab but also in the field.
Steven will be supervising a PhD student who will be using experiments to study whether competitive tenders can enhance the willingness of participants to collaborate in situations of joint-benefit co-production, while another (using e.g. insights from cooperative game theory)  will study which design and operational factors contribute best to the success of agricultural cooperatives. </p>

<p> I am a resource economist with specialization in non-market valuation of environmental assets. My research interests include understanding why people value the environment, and what are the factors that affect people’s willingness to pay for environmental assets. I’m particularly interested in exploring how socio-economic factors and social psychological factors play a role in influencing people’s preferences for the environment, and how to design incentives to engage people in pro-environmental behaviour. I have worked across many research domains, including marine park management, urban water demand and supply management, rural and irrigation water management, transportation choice, land use management, technology adoption, and climate change. </p>

<img class="right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}images/iain.jpg"alt="" title="Iain Walker" >

**Research interests**
<p> I am a research scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia's national science body. My major research interests are in social sciences and sustainability, the social psychology of intergroup relations (especially prejudice and stereotyping), and relative deprivation and social justice. My work is aimed at applying social scientific knowledge to pressing social issues, from prejudice to climate change, and understanding and engaging with processes of social practice and social change. Behind this lurks a broader concern with developing a better theoretical understanding of sociality and the interplay between theory and practice. My overarching science goal is to develop a coherent account of sociality to allow for more potent and durable environmental, social, and behavioural change. My current research efforts include a long-term project on public understandings of climate change, a new project investigating the links between ecosystem services and human wellbeing in an integrated water resources management context, a newish project looking at social and behavioural interventions to enhance biosecurity, and a nascent project on science and praxis. I co-authored with Martha Augoustinos and Ngaire Donaghue 'Social cognition: An integrated introduction' (3rd ed., 2014), co-edited with Heather Smith 'Relative deprivation theory: Specification, development, integration' (2002) and with Gail Moloney 'Social representations and identity: Content, process, and power' (2007), and written and co-written about 150 chapters, papers, conference papers, and reports. Prior to joining CSIRO, I was a Professor of Psychology at Murdoch University, where I also served as Dean of the School of Psychology and as Executive Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences. </p>

**Research interests** 
<p> I am a social and environmental psychology PhD student at UWA and have a studentship with the CSIRO's Land & Water flagship. My research focuses on the psychological and social factors that predict engagement with climate change and pro-environmental behaviours. I am currently exploring ideas such as psychological distance, construal level, field theory, embodied cognition and social networks. The scope of my research, and my interest in behavioural economics extends to areas such as discounting (time, and other types of discounting, such as social and spatial), cognitive biases, and public goods games. In 2014, I tutored the third year <a href="http://www.unitoutlines.science.uwa.edu.au/Units/PSYC3310/SEM-2/2014/CRAWLEY/ ">Behavioural Economics</a> unit at UWA (PSYC3310 Special Topics), and held a seminar on social preferences in decision-making. </p>
