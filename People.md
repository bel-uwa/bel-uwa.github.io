<p> <img style="float: right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}images/sayed.jpg"alt="" title="Sayed Iftekhar" width="375" height="300"> I am an environmental and resource economist. I have experience in using many tools such as laboratory and field experiments, agent based modelling, bio-economic modelling and community surveys. I have research interests on many aspects of natural resource and environmental management, such as, agri-environmental service payment, inter-generational equity, role of social networks, endogenous network formation, coordination games,  preferences of equity norms, equity-efficiency trade-offs, risk aversion in public decision making, mechanism design and non-market valuation of water resources. </p>

<p> <img style="float: right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}images/zoe.jpg"alt="" title="Zoe Leviston" width="300" height="350"> Dr Zoe Leviston is a social psychologist with the CSIRO's Land & Water Flagship. Her research investigates how individuals, groups, and culture shape people's responses to natural resource challenges, including water security, agricultural management, and resource consumption. Dr Leviston applies social science to a broad range of natural resource domains, however, her key research foci are in climate change mitigation and adaptation, agricultural land management practice, and public acceptance of water supply schemes. Her particular research interests concern how elements such as social identity, personality traits, and beliefs about others' social behaviour influence how we process information about environmental threats such as climate change and fossil fuel-based energy production. Dr Leviston's current research investigates the Australian public's response to climate change, including adaptation literacy, pro-environmental behaviour, and coping. </p>

**Research interests**
<p> <img style="float: right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}images/steve.jpg"alt="" title="Steven Schilizzi" width="375" height="300"> Steven Schilizzi’s current research interests focus around two main problems: first, to understand what factors explain bidding behaviour and bidder participation in competitive tenders used for environmental conservation, and their resulting economic performance; and second, to understand what factors explain people’s views of “what’s fair” (or equitable) in connection with resource allocation or distribution of burdens, and how that interacts with resource use efficiency. Both research programs rely heavily on experimental research, in the lab but also in the field.
Steven will be supervising a PhD student who will be using experiments to study whether competitive tenders can enhance the willingness of participants to collaborate in situations of joint-benefit co-production, while another (using e.g. insights from cooperative game theory)  will study which design and operational factors contribute best to the success of agricultural cooperatives. </p>
